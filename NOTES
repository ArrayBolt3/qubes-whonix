Current issues:

  - Need a utility to search for files with IP address pattern during installation.
    - consider a FUSE type module that 'intercepts' file open and can change
      output of the configuration file on the fly with something like jinja2.
    - Currently the list is manually generated

  - Look into kde dialog issue where dialogs do not appear focused

Likely Solved Issues:

  - qubes-whonixsetup: Add back in check for disabled Tor and run setup again
    on boot if its disabled.  Could be disabled via 'whonix-tor-disable' service
