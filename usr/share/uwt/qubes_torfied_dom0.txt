Please make sure Whonix-Gateway (commonly called sys-whonix) is running.

- If you are using Qubes R3.2: The NetVM of this TemplateVM should be set to Whonix-Gateway (commonly called sys-whonix).

- If you are using Qubes R4 or higher: Check your _dom0_ /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.UpdatesProxy settings.

_At the very top_ of that file you should have the following:

$tag:whonix-updatevm $default allow,target=sys-whonix

To see if it is fixed, try running in Whonix TemplateVM:

sudo systemctl restart qubes-whonix-torified-updates-proxy-check

Then try to update / use apt-get again.
